## Intro to programming tools

---

### Tools we'll use throughout the course

- Git : Verson control system
- Anaconda : Manage programming environment
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive python scripting
- OpenCV : Image processing library
- Tensorflow : Deep learning framework by Google
- Keras : High level neural network API

### Let's practice git
[Learn git in your browser](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)  
[Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
To download course material, type this in git bash
    
    C:\>git clone https://github.com/ChaoyuanYeh/deep-learning-cv.git

---

### Anaconda 
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
#### Conda
Data science package and environment manager. 

---

#### Create and activate a conda environment 

[conda user gide](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/index.html)

Create a conda environment.     
    
    C:\>conda create -n env_name python=3.6
    
Activate conda environment

    C:\>activate env_name
    
Install packages

    (env_name) C:\>conda install ... 
    (env_name) C:\>pip install ...
    
To make it easier, use an environment yaml file

    C:\>conda env create -f environment.yml

### The Jupyter Notebook

The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing. 

The Jupyter notebook combines two components:

-A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents

-Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application
